# AliceOS kernel

## What?

Yes, I want to write a kernel. Any problem with that?

## How?

Lowest level parts of the kernel are done in x86 assembly (nasm), everything else is pure C.

I'm not very experienced but I try to learn from other projects.

## Why?

Why not?

I like to learn new things. I like to study all kinds of things about software development, so why not learn about kernels?

After being introduced to the whole OSDev scene this caught my curiosity. So I wanted to try it too.

This project called ToAruOS (https://github.com/klange/osdev) inspired me. It looks nice and I want to try making something similar.

## When?

I first need to finish my coreutils and other related projects before I can make an entire system.

AliceOS is going to be made of this kernel, plus Au as the userland.

Everything is meant to be built and linked and whatever with ABSOLUTELY NO GNU SOFTWARE OR LIBRARIES (after all this is the main purpose of the project).

Note that this also includes software released under the GPL (or similar) license.

(Currently I can't find a linker that is not part of GNU binutils, what a shame)

(I just noticed some parts of yasm were (L)GPL, so I stopped using it, I've also been told it's a dead project)

## Who?

Mostly me, with help from other people. For a list of contributors, check the CONTRIBUTORS file.

## You are insane

Whatever.
