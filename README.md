# AliceOS kernel

## What?

Yes, I want to write a kernel. Any problem with that?

## How?

I don't even know.

I'm currently trying to find decent tutorials that are not 32-bit exclusive and require a 32-bit host system to develop properly.

## Why?

Why not?

I like to learn new things. I like to study all kinds of things about software development, so why not learn about kernels?

After being introduced to the whole OSDev scene this caught my curiosity. So I wanted to try it too.

This project called ToAruOS ( https://github.com/klange/osdev ) inspired me. It looks nice and I want to try making something similar.

## When?

I first need to finish my coreutils and other related projects before I can make an entire system.

AliceOS is going to be made of this kernel, and have Au slapped onto it.

Everything is meant to be built and linked and whatever with ABSOLUTELY NO GNU SOFTWARE OR LIBRARIES (after all this is the main purpose of the project).

## Who?

Just me. I might ask for help if I get stuck on something, anyway, but only I will do the whole development. I wouldn't learn anything otherwise.

## You are insane

Whatever.
