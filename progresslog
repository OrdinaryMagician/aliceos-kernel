This is kind of a progress log for the development of AliceOS.
Future phases and plans will be very vague and subject to change.
Please do not expect any of them to come true.
Tasks aren't exactly ordered.

Legend:
- To do
X Done
P Partial
F Failed
C Currently in progress

Shanghai phase:
  X Start project
  F Follow JamesM's tutorial step by step (it didn't work well)
  X Restart project
  X VGA text mode
  X Implement printk()
  X Serial port driver
  X Memory and string functions
  X Extended VGA graphics
  X Commandline handling
  X Ramdisk support
  X Framebuffer console
  X BGA driver (Bochs/QEMU)
  X GDT, IDT...
  X IRQs
  X PIT
  P Fix generic VGA drivers to work on real hardware (Boy do I hate this one)
  X PS/2 Keyboard input
  - Fix PS/2 keyboard in VMWare and real hardware (none / duplicate keypresses)
  - PS/2 Mouse input
  P Internal shell (needs some fixes here and there)
  P Dynamic memory (kalloc/krealloc/kfree, right now stack based)
  - Proper RAM detection (Bootloaders can lie sometimes)
  X Paging
  P Basic PCI/PCI-e support (required for more drivers)
  - VMWare graphics driver
  - QEMU Virgil3D driver (delay to next phase if not usable yet)
  - BGA linear framebuffer (currently using bank mode and it's slow)
  - ACPI interface (who in their right mind would do OOP on hardware level?)
  C Multitasking (still stuck in here)
  P Syscalls (the system itself works, that's for sure)
  - Rewrite paging (code is currently a carbon copy from jamesm's tutorial)
  P Better HCF with named symbols and stack tracing
  - ELF loader (last step, very very important to reach Hourai phase)
